This Power BI dashboard uses the IBM HR Analytics dataset to analyze employee attrition. It investigates the relationship between turnover and variables like department, job satisfaction, tenure, and income. The project mimics an internal human resources report for a made-up business called Spire Capital Inc., emphasizing important findings and evidence-based suggestions to lower attrition and boost retention.
